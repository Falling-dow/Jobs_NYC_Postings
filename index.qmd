# Introduction
As graduate students, many of us are currently exploring job and internship opportunities, so we thought it would be interesting to look into government jobs in New York City. This dataset provides information about job openings on the City of New York’s official jobs site, which includes both internal postings (for city employees) and external ones (open to the public). We want to explore questions like: what kinds of jobs are available in different government departments or sectors, what the salaries look like, and whether most of these jobs are internal or open to everyone. I’m also curious to see what career levels (entry-level, experienced, etc.) are in demand. This project will give us a better understanding of what government job opportunities look like and how accessible they are.
